# my vim configs

This repo is for my personal benefit for making my own vimrc and its dependency portable (at least on Unix-like Operating Systems)

## usages

For installing all the dependencies, 
```
$ ./script/install
```

For just installing the .vimrc
```
$ ./script/install-easy
```

For copying .vimrc data from $HOME dir to this repo,

```
$ ./script/steal
```
